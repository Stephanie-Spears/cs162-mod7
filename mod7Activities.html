<p>Read and study the following chapter of Malik:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linked Lists</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;We will focus on linear linked list for this week.</p>
<p>When you feel you have a good grasp of the concepts of this module you should start working on Project 5 and lab 6.</p>
<p><a href="avi/formatting.wmv" target="_self"></a>However, before you begin I recommend you view the videos I put together which review some of the concepts of this module and give you hints about the lab.</p>
<p>As always, it is essential that your coding style follows the style guidelines for this class, which you can find <a href="../module1/styleGuide.doc" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>. Use of good style and good program design is a requirement for a good score on each assignment.</p>
<p>Finally, don't forget you need to complete the on-line quiz 6 by the published due date. As before, you will have 2 possible attempts to complete this, and your highest score is the one that counts.</p>
